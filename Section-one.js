//Number one

// Number two
// ) function myFunction() {} B
// Number three 
console.log(typeof(3 + '3')); // 33 and its a string since it was concatenated not added C
// Number four 
// float we dont use float in js C
// Number five 
let arr = [1, 2, 3]; 
console.log(arr.length); // answer is 3 since length counts how many are there where it has counted 3 B
// Number six A
console.log( Boolean('false')); // Answer is true since boolean was asked if false is a boolean then answer answer turns out to be a boolean A
// Number seven
// Another one to use is Array.isArray(x) to mean x instanceof Array B
// Number eight
let x = "5"; 
console.log(x == 5); // True converts the string "5" to a number 5, and since 5 == 5, it returns true
console.log(x === 5); // False C strict equality (===) operator, which does not perform type conversion JavaScript does not convert "5" into a number and simply returns false.
